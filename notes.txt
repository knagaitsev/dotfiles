Things I want:
- Searching feature to rapidly search across files `search ...`

- Good copy-paste support
- Good scrolling
- auto formatting of code
- Git diff feature

TODO:
- Update this README explaining how to install this repo
    - Need to get nvim dependencies before using installer in tools
- Make a `search` alias command for grep, install it with dotfiles
- Figure out how to do remote vscode `code` command
- Make mac windows open up separately rather than piling up
